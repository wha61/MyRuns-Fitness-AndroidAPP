# MyRuns-Fitness-AndroidAPP

MyRuns is an Android fitness application designed to track and log various exercise activities while providing real-time location updates using the Google Maps API. It offers users the capability to monitor their workout progress, including speed, distance, and route taken, which is visually represented on a map for easy navigation and review. The app also archives each workout session in a history tab for future reference. 

Additionally, the settings tab provides customization options, allowing users to tailor the app according to their personal preferences.
This app utilizes the GoogleMaps API to display the user's location and track their movement in order to display the speed, distance, etc. The app also features activity recognition that detects whether the user is sitting, walking, or running through a classification model in Weka.

A standout feature of MyRuns is its integrated activity recognition technology, which employs a sophisticated classification model developed in Weka. This model accurately identifies the user's current activity state, distinguishing between states such as sitting, walking, and running, thereby enhancing the app's capability to provide activity-specific tracking and insights.
